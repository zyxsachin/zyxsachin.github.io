<h1>Zetnus and Water are bullies.</h1>
<p>You need to listen. What you are doing is WRONG. It is not going to get any less wrong if you silence me.
<p>Bullies don't always realize the gravity of what they are doing. When you are however not only ignoring those that ask you to stop but take active steps to block them out there is no doubt that you are intentionally malicious. Stop this. Stop enabling bullie
<p>Stop this insanity. Stop making excuses for abuse. Stop helping abusers hide their abuse. Stop helping bullies get away with bullying. Stop turning a blind eye when asked to stop this. Stop pretending that you can't do anything. Stop thinking this does not concern you. If you refuse to listen to victims because the truth is inconvenient then you too become party to the abuse.
