		Welcome to this site about rhinos! The actual name is rhinoceres, but rhino is more frequently used.
		Rhino are the second largest land animals after elephants, but they are not as popular or known as them, so this site will hopefully help people find out more about rhinos and the challenges they face.

		There are five rhino species: White, Black, Indian, Sumatran and Javan. Most of the species have subspecies which tend to be diffrentiate. 
		The species themselves have characteristics with which they can be distinguished, such as size or number of horns.

			Many people think of all rhinos having two horns, or that all rhinos come from Africa, while some people might have heard about the Indian rhino. 
			The Javan and Sumatran rhino are virtually unknown, and this is due making up only 0.5% of the total rhino population combined, as seen in the figure below.

		<p>
			The Sumatran rhino is only seen in captivity in one place outside Indonesia and Malaysia, and the Javan rhino is not seen in captivity currently, so it is understandable why they are unknown.
			Many people might also not be able to see the differences between the rhino species. Hopefully the table and the graphic on this page will help a bit.

		<p class="responsive"> 
		The white rhinoceros is the largest of all of current rhino species. 
		A name better suited to it is its alternative name, the square-lipped rhino. The square lips are perfectly adapted for it to eat its diet of grass.
		With it can forage grass efficiently and does not have pick grass pieces one by one. It has two horns, of which the one further away from the face is larger.
		</p>

		<p class="responsive"> 
		There are two sub species of the white rhino : the southern and the northern. There are approximately 20000 southern white rhinos in the wild. Its conservation status is Not Threatened. 
		They can be found in southern Africa, in nations like South Africa, Namibia, etc. It has also been introduced to east Africa, in Kenya and Tanzania.
		</p>

		<p class="responsive"> 
		The northern white rhino has only three remaining individuals left. It is essentially functionally extinct, meaning that there is no realistic chance that the population can recover.
		It used to be able to found in DRC Congo and Uganda, but now all individuals came from a zoo in Czech Republic and live in Kenya.
		</p>

		<h4 class="triv"> Did you know? </h4>
		<ul>
		  <li class="trivia" style="list-style-type:circle">According to the ranger who was guided me through Kruger National Park, 
		  white rhinos are the only rhinos which can not swim. 
		This is due to them not being able to lift their high enough, as they forage only on the ground. </li>

		<p class="responsive"> 
		Black rhinos can be found in eastern and southern Africa, in places like South Africa, Namibia, Kenya and Tanzania. 
		There used to be a population in Cameroon, but it has become extinct in the last few decades.
		</p>
		
		<p class="responsive"> 
		The population was 65000 in the 1970. Between 1970 and 1992 the population collapsed by 96% to 2300. It has made a comeback to 5000 individuals but there is long way to go.
		There are eight subspecies (or five according to an alternative classification), but three of them are extinct and one is almost extinct, all in the last hundred years. 
		The other four subspecies are also under great risk, and have to be protected, or even more subspecies will become extinct. 
		If nothing is done, the days of the whole species may be numbered in just a few decades.

		The Indian rhino is the largest and most populous of the Asian rhinos. The population was less than 200 in the early 1900s, but has since made a comback to 3500 individuals.
		Most of the population lives in the northeastern Indian state of Assam. They can also be found in Nepal. They are also frequently seen in zoos, and very comfortable in water.
		Its body looks quite different compared to African rhinos. The pattern on the body is split into three parts, which almost look like armor.

		The Sumatran looks the most distinct of all rhinos with its layer of thin air on its body. There are three subspecies : Eastern, Western and Chittagong. 
		The Chittagong subspecies is extinct and used to be found in India and Bangaladesh. The Eastern Sumatran rhino has about 15 individuals in Borneo.
		The Western subspecies lives in Sumatra, but is extinct in West Malaysia. The individuals live in 4 fragmented populations. There are about 10 living in captivity.

		<h2> Rhino poaching </h2>
		
		<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"></script> 
		
		
		<p class="responsive"> 
			Rhino poaching is an issue which is threatening the continued existence of rhinos in the wild. 
			Before the 2000s, rhinos were hunted for their horns, which were used as decorations in the Middle East, making the population collapse. Fortunately this stopped by the year 2000.
			As seen in the chart below, for the last few years, more than a 1000 rhinos die every year. Rhinos are poached for their horn, which are used in traditional chinese medicine.
			Rhino horn is made of keratin, which is the same material as human finger/toe nails. This means that rhino horn also has the same medicinal properties. 
			Since finger nails are actually not used in medicine, this of course means that rhino horn also have no medicinal benefits. 
		</p>
		<p class="responsive">
			Rhinos are slaughtered for medicine based on superstition. While in the 2000s poaching rates were low, the increased wealth of China and Vietnam have increased the interest in traditional chinese medicine.
			Prices for rhino horn reportedly are higher than prices for gold and platinum. This allowed poachers to use sophisticated equipment like machine guns and helicopters, while rangers use normal rifles.
			Unfortunately, rhinos are not the only species threatened by traditional chinese medicine. 
			Elephants, tigers, pangolins, vaquitas and many other species are at risk.
