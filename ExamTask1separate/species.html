		</figure>
		
		<p class="responsive"> 
		The white rhinoceros is the largest of all of current rhino species. 
		A name better suited to it is its alternative name, the square-lipped rhino. The square lips are perfectly adapted for it to eat its diet of grass.
		With it can forage grass efficiently and does not have pick grass pieces one by one. It has two horns, of which the one further away from the face is larger.
		</p>

		<p class="responsive"> 
		There are two sub species of the white rhino : the southern and the northern. There are approximately 20000 southern white rhinos in the wild. Its conservation status is Not Threatened. 
		They can be found in southern Africa, in nations like South Africa, Namibia, etc. It has also been introduced to east Africa, in Kenya and Tanzania.
		</p>

		<p class="responsive"> 
		The northern white rhino has only three remaining individuals left. It is essentially functionally extinct, meaning that there is no realistic chance that the population can recover.
		It used to be able to found in DRC Congo and Uganda, but now all individuals came from a zoo in Czech Republic and live in Kenya.
		</p>

		<h4 class="triv"> Did you know? </h4>
		<ul>
		  <li class="trivia" style="list-style-type:circle">According to the ranger who was guided me through Kruger National Park, 
		  white rhinos are the only rhinos which can not swim. 
		This is due to them not being able to lift their high enough, as they forage only on the ground. </li>
		  
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3> Black Rhino </h3>

			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		
		<p class="responsive"> 
		Black rhinos can be found in eastern and southern Africa, in places like South Africa, Namibia, Kenya and Tanzania. 
		There used to be a population in Cameroon, but it has become extinct in the last few decades.
		</p>
		
		<p class="responsive"> 
		The population was 65000 in the 1970. Between 1970 and 1992 the population collapsed by 96% to 2300. It has made a comeback to 5000 individuals but there is long way to go.
		There are eight subspecies (or five according to an alternative classification), but three of them are extinct and one is almost extinct, all in the last hundred years. 
		The other four subspecies are also under great risk, and have to be protected, or even more subspecies will become extinct. 
		If nothing is done, the days of the whole species may be numbered in just a few decades.
		</p>
		
		<h4 class="triv"> Did you know? </h4>
		<ul>
		  <li class="trivia" style="list-style-type:circle">The black rhino has a hook shaped lip, which allows it to eat leaves effectively. 
		  This is where its alternative name, hook lipped rhino comes from.</li>

		<h3> Indian Rhino </h3>

		</figure>
		
		<p class="responsive"> 
		The Indian rhino is the largest and most populous of the Asian rhinos. The population was less than 200 in the early 1900s, but has since made a comback to 3500 individuals.
		Most of the population lives in the northeastern Indian state of Assam. They can also be found in Nepal. They are also frequently seen in zoos, and very comfortable in water.
		Its body looks quite different compared to African rhinos. The pattern on the body is split into three parts, which almost look like armor.

		<h3> Sumatran Rhino </h3>

		<p class="responsive"> 
		The Sumatran rhino is most threatened of all rhinos. There are about 100 left, but they are fragmented the population is decreasing.
		The Sumatran looks the most distinct of all rhinos with its layer of thin air on its body. There are three subspecies : Eastern, Western and Chittagong. 
		The Chittagong subspecies is extinct and used to be found in India and Bangaladesh. The Eastern Sumatran rhino has about 15 individuals in Borneo.
		The Western subspecies lives in Sumatra, but is extinct in West Malaysia. The individuals live in 4 fragmented populations. There are about 10 living in captivity.
		</p>
		
		
		<h4 class="triv"> Did you know? </h4>
		
		<ul>
		  <li class="trivia" style="list-style-type:circle">In the 1980s 40 rhinos were transported to zoos around the world. 
		  They adapted horrendously to captivity and only three remained by 1997. 
		  Fortunately, in 2001 the first captive birth of a Sumatran Rhino was observed, with three more in the years following.</li>

		<h3> Javan Rhino </h3>

		<p class="responsive"> 

		The Javan rhino is the rarest of all rhino species. With only about 60 rhinos left and none in captivity, the Javan rhino is critically endangered.
		There used to be three subspecies: Indonesian, Vietnamese and Indian. The Indian and Vietnamese subspecies are both extinct. 
		All 60 individuals can be found in Ujong Kulon National Park on Java, Indonesia.
		</p>
		<p class="responsive"> 
		They only have one horn and look quite similar to Indian rhinos, but smaller in size.
		</p>

		
		<h4 class="triv"> Did you know? </h4>
		
		<ul>
		  <li class="trivia" style="list-style-type:circle">There is still to this day very little known about Javan rhinos. 
		  The last Javan rhino in captivity was displayed as Indian rhino over a century ago.</li>
		  <li class="trivia" style="list-style-type:circle">	The Vietnamese population was presumed to have become extinct due to the Vietname War, 
		  but they somehow survived and were discovered again in 1988. Unfortunately the last rhino in Vietnam died in 2010.</li>
